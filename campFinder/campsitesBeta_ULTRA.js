In 1770, two explorers named the mountain La Sierra de Nuestro Padre de San Francisco, which was later changed to the Miwok word Tamalpais. With the Gold Rush of 1849, San Francisco grew; and more people began to use Mount Tamalpais for recreation. Trails were developed, and a wagon road was built.
